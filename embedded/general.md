# General questions

- What is the difference between RAM and ROM?
  
RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of memory that is **volatile**, meaning its contents are lost when power is turned off. It is used to temporarily store data and program instructions that the processor needs to access quickly. RAM can be written to and read from, making it useful for storing variables and dynamic data.

ROM (Read-Only Memory) is a type of memory that is **non-volatile**, meaning its contents are retained even when power is turned off. It is used to store permanent data and program instructions that do not need to be changed. ROM is read-only, meaning it cannot be written to after it has been programmed, making it useful for storing firmware, bootloader code, and other critical system code.

In summary, the key difference between RAM and ROM is that RAM is volatile and can be written to and read from, while ROM is non-volatile and read-only.

- Explain the role of the linker in software development.

In software development, the linker plays a critical role in the final stage of the build process. **The linker is a program that combines the object files generated by the compiler into a single executable program or library that can be executed by the computer's processor**. Here are some key functions of the linker in software development:

Symbol resolution: The linker resolves any external symbols referenced by the object files by searching for their definitions in other object files or libraries. It ensures that all the symbols used in the program are correctly linked and available at runtime.

Address binding: The linker assigns addresses to the symbols in the program, determining where each function or variable will be located in memory at runtime. It also resolves any relative addresses used in the program, ensuring that they point to the correct memory location.

Code and data optimization: The linker can optimize the code and data in the program by removing unused functions and data, merging identical functions and data, and reordering code to improve performance.

Library management: The linker can link in external libraries that contain pre-written code that the program can use. This can save time and effort in development by allowing programmers to use existing code rather than writing their own from scratch.

Platform-specific tasks: The linker may also perform platform-specific tasks, such as creating dynamic libraries or DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) that can be loaded and unloaded at runtime, or generating debugging information that can be used to diagnose errors in the program.

In summary, the linker is a critical component in software development that combines object files into a single executable program or library, resolves external symbols, assigns memory addresses, optimizes code and data, links external libraries, and performs platform-specific tasks. Without the linker, it would be impossible to produce a working executable program from the source code.
