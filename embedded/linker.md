# Linker

## Chat GPT

**I:**
But as i know,I can also use gcc command to generate the excutable file instead of ld(GNU linker).
通常情况下，gcc编译时同时也执行了链接器的功能。

**Char GPT:**
Yes, that's correct! In fact, when you use the gcc command to compile and link a C program, it actually uses the GNU linker (ld) under the hood.

When you run the gcc command, it performs several steps behind the scenes. First, it runs the preprocessor (cpp) to expand any #include directives and perform other macro expansions. Next, it runs the compiler proper (cc1) to generate object files from the source code. Finally, it runs the linker (ld) to link the object files and any necessary libraries to create the final executable.

For example, to compile and link a C program using gcc, you can simply run:

```
$ gcc main.c -o my_program
```

This command will compile the main.c file into an object file, and then link it with any necessary libraries to create an executable called my_program. Behind the scenes, gcc is using ld to perform the linking step.

So while you can certainly use ld directly to link object files and libraries into an executable, it is more common to use gcc, which handles all the necessary steps automatically.
