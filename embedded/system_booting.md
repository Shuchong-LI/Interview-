## BIOS and UEFI

BIOS and UEFI are firmware interfaces that are used to initialize and configure hardware components when a computer is turned on. They provide a set of basic services that are required for the operating system to take over and begin running.

BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System, and it is the traditional firmware interface that has been used in computers for several decades. BIOS firmware is stored in a chip on the motherboard of the computer, and it is responsible for performing a series of tests and checks on the hardware components when the computer is turned on. It also provides a basic set of services to the operating system, such as input/output operations and disk access.

UEFI, which stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, is a newer firmware interface that is gradually replacing BIOS in modern computers. UEFI provides a more modern and flexible interface for firmware, with improved security features and support for larger storage devices. Unlike BIOS, UEFI firmware is stored in non-volatile memory on the motherboard, and it provides more advanced configuration options and a larger set of services to the operating system.

Both BIOS and UEFI are essential components of the boot process in a computer system. They initialize and configure the hardware components, and provide a set of basic services to the operating system, allowing it to take over and begin running.
